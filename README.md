The "Data Duplication Removal Using File Checksum" project is a comprehensive solution designed to identify and eliminate duplicate data within a given dataset using file checksums. 
Data duplication is a common challenge in various industries and can lead to inefficient use of storage resources, increased backup times, and compromised data integrity. 
This project addresses these issues by employing a robust checksum-based approach to identify and manage duplicate files.
We have a folder name 'Duplicate' containing two identical files 'File1' and 'File2', if we run this code, it will delete the duplicate File 'File2' automatically.
